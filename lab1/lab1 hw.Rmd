```{r}
+5-3*2
```
```{r}
+8/2**2
```


5. I guess the second expression suprised me because I don't know what the double asteriks means, I am assuming it means divide.
```{r}
(5-3)*2
```
```{r}
(8/2)*2*2
```


```{r}
pi <- 3.14159265359
```
```{r}
pi*2
```


```{r}
?mean
x <- c(2, 8, 6, 6, 7, 4, 9, 9, 9, 10)
mean(x)
```
```{r}
x <- c(2, 8, 6, 6, 7, 4, 9, 9, 9, 10)
median(x)
```
